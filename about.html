      <p>Hi, I’m <span class="name" id="one"> SHAHBAZ AHMED,</span> <br> a passionate and aspiring web developer from
     <span class="city"> KARACHI, PAKISTAN, </span><br> born on April 25, 2004.   As the son of <span class="SO">MALIK NOOR MUHAMMAD,</span> <br>  
       I’ve always been encouraged to pursue my ambitions and dream
      big. <br> Currently, I’m pursuing my <span class="edu">undergraduate degree,</span> <br> and I’m focused on
      expanding my skills in web development,  particularly in front-end

      I enjoy building dynamic, <br>user-friendly websites that offer seamless
